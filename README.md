KitchenGarden
=============

The code in this repository is a part of my bachelor project at DTU.

The software is intended to run a self regulating kitchen garden (Greenhouse).
The gardening automation is run by an Arduino and lets it water itself, cool if it is too hot and turn on a lamp if it needs more daylight.
It can measure the moisture in the soil, the light levels, the temperature and the humidity.
It can be controlled via bluetooth.
