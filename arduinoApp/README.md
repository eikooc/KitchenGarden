Arduino based self-regulating garden
=====================

This is the Arduino software that regulates the hardware.
Included in this README are the sketch, links to the libraries and the datasheets for the sensors and a drawing of the wire connections.

The sketch is used to automate gardening via activation of relay's connected to water, light and temperature regulating tools. It does so based on readings from sensors connected to the Arduino.

## Installation


### Libraries
To compile and upload the sketch to an Arduino you need the libraries used
To [install libraries](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) in the Arduino IDE just do 
*Sketch > Import Library*
And then choose the library.

+ List of libraries used with link to download it:
 + [DHT22 sensor library](https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTlib)
 + [SHT10 sensor library](https://github.com/practicalarduino/SHT1x)

### Datasheets
